# Campaign Fundraising & Electoral Success Analysis

This project analyzes the impact of fundraising on electoral outcomes in the 2022 U.S. congressional elections. Using Federal Election Commission (FEC) data, we explore trends in candidate contributions, vote shares, and election performance across party lines. The analysis includes both exploratory data visualizations and predictive modeling using Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Random Forest classifiers.

## Project Structure

- `EDA_GLM_and_Forest.ipynb`: Main notebook with data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development
- `candidate_summary_2022.csv`: Summary of candidate fundraising data
- `house_elec.csv`, `senate_elec.csv`: Election result files for House and Senate races
- `dem_candidates.csv`, `rep_candidates.csv`: Primary election data by party

## Key Insights

- Visualized fundraising disparities between winning and losing candidates
- Modeled the probability of electoral success using GLM and Random Forest
- Identified vote share and total contributions as significant predictors of winning

## Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub for version control
